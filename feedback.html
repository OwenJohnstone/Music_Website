        <h1>Drake</h1>
        <p>His music is what you expect music nowadays to be </p>
        <p>the same as everyone and he doesnt write his own lyrics</p>
        <p>so all im saying is that he needs to write his own stuff</p>

        <h1>Migos</h1>
        <p>There music is just beats with mumbles over them</p>
        <p>and most of there song just consist of the same thing over and over</p>
        <p>so they need to be more clear and be less repetative</p>
